Increase online conversions with a "Call to Action" bar at the bottom of your blog posts. Customize the button text and colors.

== Description ==

Display a call to action at the bottom of your blog post. You want your visitors to do something on every page. If you are writing about a service you offer, you link the post to that service and a "call to action" bar will appear at the bottom of the post. This will help improve online conversions. Direct your visitors where you want them next.

With this plugin, you create a relationship from a blog post, to post of another post type for displaying a call-to-action at the bottom of the post. In the example above, you link your post to the service your post is about.

Once activated, a metabox will appear in the post editor with available posts to choose from. After choosing the post you want associated, the box appears at the bottom of your post.

Use for services, portfolios and even standard pages. Give it a try today.

It's easy to use and simple to set up. From one simple settings screen, you can:

* Set the post type association
* Include featured images to dress up the action bar
* Change action bar colors
* Set the default button text
* Metabox allows each post to have a different call to action
